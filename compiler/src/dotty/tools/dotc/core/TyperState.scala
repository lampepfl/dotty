   *  A note on merging: An interesting test case is isApplicableSafe.scala. It turns out that this
   *  requires a context merge using the new `&' operator. Sequence of actions:
   *  1) Typecheck argument in typerstate 1.
   *  2) Cache argument.
   *  3) Evolve same typer state (to typecheck other arguments, say)
   *     leading to a different constraint.
   *  4) Take typechecked argument in same state.
   *
   * It turns out that the merge is needed not just for
   * isApplicableSafe but also for (e.g. erased-lubs.scala) as well as
   * many parts of dotty itself.
