/** This phase makes all erased term members of classes private so that they cannot
 *  conflict with non-erased members. This is needed so that subsequent phases like
 *  ResolveSuper that inspect class members work correctly.
 *  The phase also replaces all expressions that appear in an erased context by
 *  default values. This is necessary so that subsequent checking phases such
 *  as IsInstanceOfChecker don't give false negatives.
 *  Finally, the phase replaces `compiletime.uninitialized` on the right hand side
 *  of a mutable field definition by `_`. This avoids a "is declared erased, but is
 *  in fact used" error in Erasure and communicates to Constructors that the
 *  variable does not have an initializer.
