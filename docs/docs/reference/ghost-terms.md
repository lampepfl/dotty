Why ghost terms?
----------------------
The following examples shows an implementation of a simple state machine which can be in a state `On` or `Off`.
The machine can change state from `Off` to `On` with `turnedOn` only if it is currently `Off`. This last constraint is
captured with the `IsOff[S]` implicit evidence which only exists for `IsOff[Off]`.
For example, not allowing calling `turnedOn` on in an `On` state as we would require an evidence of type `IsOff[On]` that will not be found.

```scala
sealed trait State
final class On extends State
final class Off extends State

@implicitNotFound("State is must be Off")
class IsOff[S <: State]
object IsOff {
  implicit def isOff: IsOff[Off] = new IsOff[Off]
}

class Machine[S <: State] {
  def turnedOn(implicit ev: IsOff[S]): Machine[On] = new Machine[On]
}

val m = new Machine[Off]
m.turnedOn
m.turnedOn.turnedOn // ERROR
//                 ^
//                  State is must be Off
```

Note that in the code above the actual implicit arguments for `IsOff` are never used at runtime; they serve only to establish the right constraints at compile time.
As these terms are never used at runtime there is not real need to have them around, but they still need to be
present in some form in the generated code to be able to do separate compilation and retain binary compatiblity.

How to define ghost terms?
-------------------------------
Parameters of methods and functions can be declared as ghost, placing `ghost` at the start of the parameter list (like `implicit`).

```scala
def methodWithGhostEv(ghost ev: Ev): Int = 42

val lambdaWithGhostEv: ghost Ev => Int = 
  ghost (ev: Ev) => 42
```

`ghost` parameters will not be usable for computations, though they can be used as arguments to other `ghost` parameters.

```scala
def methodWithGhostInt1(ghost i: Int): Int =
  i + 42 // ERROR: can not use i

def methodWithGhostInt2(ghost i: Int): Int =
  methodWithGhostInt1(i) // OK
```

Not only parameters can be marked as ghost, `val` and `def` can also be marked with `ghost`. These will also only be usable as arguments to `ghost` parameters.

```scala
ghost val ghostEvidence: Ev = ...
methodWithGhostEv(ghostEvidence)
```

What happens with ghost values at runtime?
-------------------------------------------
As `ghost` are guaranteed not to be used in computations, they can and will be erased.

```scala
// becomes def methodWithGhostEv(): Int at runtime
def methodWithGhostEv(ghost ev: Ev): Int = ...  

def evidence1: Ev = ...
ghost def ghostEvidence2: Ev = ... // does not exist at runtime
ghost val ghostEvidence3: Ev = ... // does not exist at runtime

// evidence1 is not evaluated and no value is passed to methodWithGhostEv
methodWithGhostEv(evidence1)
```

State machine with ghost evidence example
------------------------------------------
The following example is an extended implementation of a simple state machine which can be in a state `On` or `Off`.
The machine can change state from `Off` to `On` with `turnedOn` only if it is currently `Off`, 
conversely from `On` to `Off` with `turnedOff` only if it is currently `On`. These last constraint are
captured with the `IsOff[S]` and `IsOn[S]` implicit evidence only exist for `IsOff[Off]` and `InOn[On]`. 
For example, not allowing calling `turnedOff` on in an `Off` state as we would require an evidence `IsOn[Off]` 
that will not be found.

As the implicit evidences of `turnedOn` and `turnedOff` are not used in the bodies of those functions 
we can mark them as `ghost`. This will remove the evidence parameters at runtime, but we would still 
evaluate the `isOn` and `isOff` implicits that where found as arguments.
As `isOn` and `isOff` are not used except as as `ghost` arguments, we can mark them as `ghost`, hence 
removing the evaluation of the `isOn` and `isOff` evidences.

```scala
import scala.annotation.implicitNotFound

sealed trait State
final class On extends State
final class Off extends State

@implicitNotFound("State is must be Off")
class IsOff[S <: State]
object IsOff {
  // def isOff will not be called at runtime for turnedOn, the compiler will only require that this evidence exists
  implicit def isOff: IsOff[Off] = new IsOff[Off]
}

@implicitNotFound("State is must be On")
class IsOn[S <: State]
object IsOn {
  // def isOn will not exist at runtime, the compiler will only require that this evidence exists at compile time
  ghost implicit val isOn: IsOn[On] = new IsOn[On]
}

class Machine[S <: State] private {
  // ev will disapear from both functions
  def turnedOn(implicit ghost ev: IsOff[S]): Machine[On] = new Machine[On]
  def turnedOff(implicit ghost ev: IsOn[S]): Machine[Off] = new Machine[Off]
}

object Machine {
  def newMachine(): Machine[Off] = new Machine[Off]
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val m = Machine.newMachine()
    m.turnedOn
    m.turnedOn.turnedOff

    // m.turnedOff
    //            ^
    //            State is must be On

    // m.turnedOn.turnedOn
    //                    ^
    //                    State is must be Off
  }
}
```


Rules
-----

1) The `ghost` modifier can appear:

* At the start of a parameter block of a method, function or class
* In a method definition
* In a `val` definition (but not `lazy val` or `var`)

```scala
ghost val x = ...
ghost def f = ...

def g(ghost x: Int) = ...

(ghost x: Int) => ...
def h(x: ghost Int => Int) = ...

class K(ghost x: Int) { ... }
```


2) A reference to an `ghost` definition can only be used

* Inside the expression of argument to an `ghost` parameter
* Inside the body of an `ghost` `val` or `def`

3) Functions

* `(ghost x1: T1, x2: T2, ..., xN: TN) => y : (ghost T1, T2, ..., TN) => R`
* `(implicit ghost x1: T1, x2: T2, ..., xN: TN) => y : (implicit ghost T1, T2, ..., TN) => R`
* `implicit ghost T1 => R  <:<  ghost T1 => R`
* `(implicit ghost T1, T2) => R  <:<  (ghost T1, T2) => R`
*  ...

Note that there is no subtype relation between `ghost T => R` and `T => R` (or `implicit ghost T => R` and `implicit T => R`)

4) Eta expansion

if `def f(ghost x: T): U` then `f: (ghost T) => U`.

5) Erasure Semantics

* All `ghost` paramters are removed from the function
* All argument to `ghost` paramters are not passed to the function
* All `ghost` definitions are removed
* All `(ghost T1, T2, ..., TN) => R` and `(implicit ghost T1, T2, ..., TN) => R` become `() => R`

6) Overloading

Method with `ghost` parameters will follow the normal overloading constraints after erasure.

7) Overriding

* Member definitions overidding each other must both be `ghost` or not be `ghost`
* `def foo(x: T): U` cannot be overriden by `def foo(ghost x: T): U` an viceversa
