Duplicate Bind
==============
In match expressions - all bound variables for a specific `case` need to be
unique. Shadowing of variables occurs per case statement. I.e. it is legal
to have

```scala
val x = ...
val y = ...

foo match {
    case x => // foo is bound to x here
    case y => // foo is bound to y here
}
```

but not in the same case.
