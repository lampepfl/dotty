Type Mismatch
=============
Mismatches occur when the compiler is expecting one type and you give it
another. I.e. if you have:

```scala
def foo(i: Int) = ???

foo("one")
```

You'll get a type mismatch - if there is no [implicit
conversion](#implicit-conversion-example) in scope.

If you have a large type error - it can sometimes be difficult to see exactly
where the mismatch occurred. In these cases the compiler will print something like:

Implicit conversion example
---------------------------
An example of an implicit conversions from `String` to `Int` could be:

```
implicit def stringToInt(str: String): Int = str.toLowerCase match {
  case "one" => 1
  case _     => ???
}
```
