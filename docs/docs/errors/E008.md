Member Not Found
================
Mistyping members happens to the best of us, and when it does - it is nice to
get some form of correction right?

Currently the compiler will suggest non-private members in place of what you
wrote. In:

```scala
class Foo {
  def bar = ???
}

val foo = new Foo

foo.barr
```

the compiler will suggest:

```none
-- [E008] Member Not Found Error: comptest/barr.scala --------------------------
7 |  foo.barr
  |  ^^^^^^^^
  |  value `barr` is not a member of Foo(Test.foo) - did you mean `foo.bar`?
```
