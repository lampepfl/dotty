Deprecated `with` operator
==========================
`with` as a type operator has been deprecated; use `&` instead.

Dotty introduces intersection types - `&` types. These replace the use of the
`with` keyword. There are a few differences in semantics between intersection
types and using `with` - `A with B` in Scala2 is ordered i.e. it is not the
same as `B with A`. In Dotty, `&`-types or unorderd.
