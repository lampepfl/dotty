Empty Catch Block
=================
A `catch` block following a `try` block needs to contain an expression to
handle errors thrown in the `try` portion. Most commonly, a pattern match will
suffice and look something like this

```scala
try {
  ...
} catch {
  case NonFatal(e) => // handle exception here!
}
```

It is recommended to use the `NonFatal` extractor to catch all exceptions as it
correctly handles transfer functions like `return`
